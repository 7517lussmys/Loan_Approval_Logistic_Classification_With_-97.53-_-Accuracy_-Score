Loan Approval Logistic Regression Model With A 97.53% Accuracy Score

  Rapidly increased costs of living, such as education, homes, and cars, have led to an overreliance on loans in America. This is backed by Experian's findings in 2024 that the average American household possesses $104,215 worth of debt. The goal of my project was to use a logistic regression to classify loan approval so that those seeking loans know if they are likely to be approved for a loan prior to even applying. This would help save time and help the user know what they need to do to improve their loan approval rates. Banks calculate a person's risk score before deciding on the approval of the loan in question. This risk score is calculated using a number of factors such as demographic details, credit history, employment status, income levels, existing debts, and other financial indicators. A substantial amount of these factors are found in the data used for creating this model, which was a synthetic data set posted to Kaggle by Lorenzo Zoppelletto with 20,000 records and 36 features. After data preprocessing and feature engineering, we were able to make a logistic regression model with an accuracy score of .975.
